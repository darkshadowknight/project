                            The Sumbingtik Festival 2024 highlighted Cainta, Rizal's rich cultural heritage 
                            through a grand float parade, colorful decorations, and signature delicacies. 
                            Among the thousands who attended was former Ilocos Sur Governor Luis "Manong Chavit" Singson, 
                            who joined the festivities as guest of honor.<br><br>
                            Coined from combining syllables from the words suman, bibingka, and latik — Cainta’s 
                            famed delicacies — the festival showcased the town’s artistry and culinary traditions.<br><br>
                            Mayor Elenita “Elen” Nieto and Municipal Administrator Johnielle Keith “Kit” Nieto led the grand 
                            parade on 30 November, with participants donning traditional attire and creatively adorned floats.<br><br>
                            Singson, dressed in a striking Muslim-inspired costume, highlighted his 
                            initiatives for public utility drivers, pledging zero-interest loans for e-trikes, 
                            motorcycles, and e-jeepneys.

                                The <b>SumBingTik Festival</b> is a well-known annual celebration held in <b>Cainta, Rizal, Philippines</b>, every December 1st. <br>
                                It is a cultural event that marks the founding anniversary of the town and honors its patron saint, <b>Our Lady of Light</b>. <br>
                                The festival’s name, <b>SumBingTik</b>, is a creative combination of three of Cainta’s most famous native delicacies: <br>
                                <b>suman</b> (sticky rice), <b>bibingka</b> (rice cake), and <b>latik</b> (coconut caramel). <br>
                                These delicacies represent the town’s rich culinary heritage and are central to the festival's identity.

                                In 2024, the SumBingTik Festival introduced a special segment called <b>SUMBINGKIDS</b>, <br>
                                which was dedicated to children and aimed at promoting health, creativity, and cultural awareness among the younger generation. <br>
                                SUMBINGKIDS featured various fun and engaging activities designed to encourage kids to participate in the festival's spirit actively. <br>
                                Among the highlights were the <b>Color Fun Run</b> and the <b>Bikers' Fun Ride</b>. <br>
                                These events were not only enjoyable but also promoted health and wellness among the children, encouraging them to engage in physical activity while having fun with their peers.

                                Apart from the physical activities, SUMBINGKIDS also included creative and cultural showcases <br>
                                where children could express their talents through <b>art</b>, <b>music</b>, and <b>dance</b>. <br>
                                This allowed them to engage with the town's traditions and appreciate the cultural significance of the festival. <br>
                                The vibrant decorations in <b>Barangay Sto. Niño</b>, where residents adorned their homes with native materials, <br>
                                further enhanced the festive atmosphere and reflected the strong sense of community among Cainta’s residents.

                                The SumBingTik Festival 2024, through <b>SUMBINGKIDS</b>, successfully created an inclusive and lively environment <br>
                                for children to explore their heritage, engage in physical activity, and build connections within their community. <br>
                                This initiative highlighted the importance of involving the younger generation in cultural traditions, <br>
                                ensuring that the rich history and culinary identity of Cainta continue to thrive for years to come. <br>
                                <b>SUMBINGKIDS</b> proved that the future of Cainta’s traditions is bright, with its youth actively participating <br>
                                and celebrating their town's unique identity.
